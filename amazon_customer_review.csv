Slow,"Got this to replace my Lenovo Tab 3--This is slllooowwww,also no grand theft auto,even though on my original Fire,,,all bought,,now nowhere?😒operating system,browser,,,stinks...I now only use for podcasts....",3.0,RickMurray666,8 October 2018
Good buy but could be quicker.,"I wanted to upgrade from my previous Kindle Fire HD8 which I bought in Nov 2015. Overall I’m pleased with my new purchase and this eighth generation. But it should be significantly quicker with a faster processor and it is only marginally quicker and some old apps I previously had on my old model no longer seem to be available with the latest update after I restored my back up to the new kindle. But for about £99 and the ease of use when buying everything digital from Amazon and being able to watch Prime Video or Netflix alongside reading books, who can grumble?!",4.0,redwolfsix,12 October 2018
A waste of money,The product is of a robust construction but with the charging dock it's quite heavy. The responce from the device screen is slow and the operating responce is generally unacceptable. The Alexa app is not very responsive and the volume is very low. The device seems a poor Echo Dot with a screen.The sound quality is terrible.My device is not able to find any apps despite having tried everything. A waste of money but for the occasional read as it functions as a good reader. If I hadn't thrown away the box I would have sent it back. What a pity it doesn't function with Android.,1.0,MAC,2 December 2018
Too buggy,"I've had so much trouble with mine. Not being able to log in to twitter, sometimes the screen refusing to sleep and the device going hot and running down the battery as a result. A couple of times it has just refused to work and I've had to let the battery rundown to restart it.Really disappointed because my previous one didnt give me this much trouble and I only replaced it because it was stolen.I only read books on it so it is giving me way more trouble than it should",1.0,Feyi Fawehinmi,10 December 2018
"If the 7's a bit too small or you fancy something fancier, get the 8","Happy with my buy. Bought to replace my 7"" which had developed screen faults*. Was confused size-wise and had actually meant to get another 7, but I don't regret the mistake. The 7 is paperback size, which is very comfortable for reading using the kindle, but I find the 8 is actually nicer for browsing and miles better for watching videos (can actually watch a tv show quite comfortably), whilst still okay for reading. Better for reading Adobe files too, which I do a lot of. Reading on either when outside in bright sunshine is difficult to impossible though, so go for a paper kindle if you really want this.games and apps: Google play store is accessible but not without a minor fiddle around (Google how to do this), so if a wide range of apps is something you want in a tablet, this will do the job if you're up for following simple instructions. Amazon apps also include Netflix and a few others, which android do not, so you can get the best of both worlds.performance: Haven't had problems playing games, pretty sure you could play all but the most demanding. I imagine Minecraft or equivalent would perform fine, rollercoaster tycoon does. Slightly better than the 7 I had, I disagree with the other comments suggesting it is worse than the 7. Still can't stream videos fast enough to watch whilst using Bluetooth simultaneously (this could be my wifi (?), I've also found internet speed affected by bluetooth on some laptops though, so I don't really blame the tablet considering the low specs), but streams fine with Bluetooth off, better than the 7. Can also download an iPlayer 1hr video in a minute or two, on the 7 it would have been much longer.Slicker looking than the 7 I had and no heavier.Biggest con: can't remove some apps I have no use for, such as Alexa (creeps me out), which takes up lots of space. Also only seems to be 10.5 gb when I ordered a 16, which I'm annoyed about, this is where the star is lost.*the 7"" survived well for about 6 months after I had cracked the screen, which is way better than other cheap tablet brands, where a crack means immediate end all- shows the quality of the fire surpasses cheap android equivalents.",4.0,Mat,20 November 2018
I wish I had waited a week during Black Friday Sale.,"To be honest, I wanted to buy the Fire HD 10 Tablet and feel a little duped by Amazon.I bought this on Black Friday Sale thinking that i had the maximum discount only to find that the following FridayI could have bought the Fire HD 10 for approximately the same price as the HD 8.Now, maybe it's me that doesn't understand how the Black Friday sales work, but I could have saved a further £40 - £50 on this itemif I had purchased it a week later, and that annoyed me.The item is a Christmas gift for a friend and knowing how well her HD 7 works I will be generous and give 4 Stars.Amazon have been my shop of choice this year and they are very good at what they do and so, instead of returning this item and awaiting my funds to be credited back, I shall learn my lesson and wait a week next year before I buy any product.",4.0,Rik Sanchez,29 November 2018
"Small, Compact, Lightweight Tablet","I play very few games on my tablet, am very much always at work but I wanted something that I could play a few games on before I go to work or when I come home at night. My old tablet was getting slow and sluggish. This not only arrived a day before it said it would, but it came in all the right packaging, it wasn't damaged or anything like that. It also comes with a nearly half full battery, which meant I didn't have to charge it up straight away. I could hit that on switch and get playing.It runs smoothly, the graphics are really good, and it plays the games I've got really well. Really worth the 79 pounds I paid for it.",5.0,Julie,11 November 2018
Disappointing,"This item may be great value if you don't mind being tied to Amazon but otherwise forget it. You can't even access the Google play store direct from this tablet and mine would not retain the wireless access code for my BT5 hub. Took it back to shop and exchanged it for a Samsung Tab, more expensive but a whole lot better.",1.0,iddychas,3 December 2018
overpriced junk,"The Tablet itself is not a patch on my Hudl2 which I bought over 4 years ago. The docking station is almost useless and apallingly bad value for money. I would recommend no one wastes their money on buying one ! most other tablets are far better value for money. This is my review and as such is my opinion based on subsequent research ,prompted by disappointment.",1.0,freethinker,1 December 2018
"Great Kindle, crap tablet","The Fire HD screen is great for the Kindle app. That's it. The rest of the Fire HD tablet features are a waste as the Fire OS is so limiting. Amazon are trying to create a captive market with this device and it's like using a kid's toy compared to any other tablet The Amazon apps are crap. Maps, Email etc are too basic to be useful in the modern world. Android apps that you can get for the Fire are limited in quantity and quality. No LinkedIn app. No PayPal app. Facebook app doesn't work properly. Silk browser is slow and you can't even replace it with Firefox or Opera. No Indeed or CV Library apps for job seekers. EVEN THE AMAZON STORE APP DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY.You can't disable any Amazon apps that you don't use so they carry on running in the background and slow the performance down. No Google play store so no access to apps that would work on any other Android device.No wonder people are working so hard to work out a way of rooting the Fire HD 8. It's a disappointing tablet that tries to make you but more from its supplier. Come on Amazon. Give us a tablet that works instead of an expensive tea tray.",1.0,Mark Hale,25 December 2018
Another disaster,"This was the 2nd Fire Tablet that I have received. The last one was a long time ago and I returned it because it would not allow me to have AVI files. I decided after much thought to convert my AVI files into MP4. and as the Tablet was in the sale, I took the plunge and ordered it. This was a waste of time and effort because when it was connected to my computer so that I could load my videos and music, the 'Fire tablet' window was blank. There were no directories. I rang Amazon and spent ages trying to resolve the issue without success. I connected another Tablet and that worked perfectly so my reasoning was that the problem is with the Fire tablet.I think I'll keep my Time2 tablet. Why did I want to change? Quite simply because I could and I felt like a change. silly me!!!",1.0,Mr. Dag Smith,12 December 2018
RE: My Estimation Of Amazon Has Plummeted!,"Hi folks,In two years I am now on my fifth Fire HD8.  The first four have all died. It seems that these devices only have a six month lifespan!INot only that, the service at the South African Amazon repair centre is dreadful.  Promises never kept, call back appointments not honoured, and agents failing to denote conversations and agreements on their system.  I have literally wasted endless hours dealing with inadequate staff.Needless to say Amazon have now list themselves a once very loyal customer!My strong advice is to buy a different model by a different manufacturer from a different retailer.Best,Paul David Seaman (UK)",1.0,monsterjazzlicks,18 November 2019
Awkward to use,"I'm finding this product one of the most awkward tablets to use I have ever had. The alexa voice control works well but the tablet seems to keep going into standby mode, where the screen goes blank and the only way to revive it is to press the on/off button to put into standby then restart again. Once the screen unlock code is entered it then makes a click and screen goes black again. Tried entering setting to change standby to 10 minutes but has no effect - sometimes it stays awake then goes into blank mode again after a while or during use (did this 3 times when trying to set up an alexa app for my Echo. After a while it calms down and seems to work OK. Interface is not as good as Android and can be a little confusing with everything heavily geared toward the Amazon apps first, to be able to get to your own. Picture is good when working and the adverts keep appearing for apps & stuff I'll never use but that's the price for a cheap unit.  Overall not bad when it behaves however my next tablet will probably be an android.",2.0,Neil B,15 December 2018
Don't waste your money.,"This is, I think, my 4th Kindle in approximately the last 12 months, and it will definitely be my last. Bar the first, which fell prey to my cat, all the others have suffered some kind of electrical/electronic failure leaving me with a dead lump of uselessness. It's getting tired and old now, and I honestly do not trust the build quality of this latest generation of Kindles. Also the sound is way too low, and the sound quality could do with some serious improvement.I actually feel quite sad that I'm posting this review as my Kindle Fire 7 HDX is still going strong 5 years after purchase (well it could do with a new battery, but that's all). However this latest generation is just not up to the same quality. When this one dies, I'll pop the money towards a cheap and cheerful laptop and do my e-reading on that.",1.0,Kindle Customer,19 July 2019
A bit of a disappointment,"The battery on my Fire7 had finally given up the ghost after roughly 4.5 years, so I thought I'd go for an upgrade in terms of both screen size and processor speed, and indulged in the Fire8. To date, I'm not sure that's the case.Pros : the screen is sharp, though I can't discern a particular improvement over the 7. It boots up faster than the 7 did. Massively cheaper than conventional tablets (eg: iPad), so expectations are not as high.Cons: the touch screen is less sensitive than my old 7 - I've set a screen password, and have to swipe several times to get the login. The  speakers are quite tinny in sound if I want to listen to a short video or similar (not a problem when viewing films, as I've paired it with Bluetooth earphones). My email ceased syncing after three days (must find time to get onto the help desk), so no email access for the past few weeks. It's slow latching onto Wi-Fi when first booted up - can take up to a minute - and I have no problems with other devices, so not just poor wi-fi.So, all in all, a bit disappointed, having been very happy with the old 7.",3.0,Mr. D. D. Fitzgerald,12 November 2019
Not as fast as I'd hoped.,"I bought this hoping it would be a lot better than the Fire HD7, the difference between the two devices in terms of performance is, to my mind, minimal although the screen is noticeably larger. I think the price for the case is absolutely scandalous, I would have preferred it if they had kept the aspect ratio of the screen the same as the older HDX models, which are still better in performance than  these newer models. Since the demise of the Amazon Underground App Store there is less going for this device. If you have a prime subscription it is a more viable prospect as you will have access to prime video and music, though the speakers are very weak. If like me you have hearing loss, you will find the speakers infuriatingly quiet. If you have Amazon Kindle books ,the device is fine for reading, but for Audible you may struggle . I tend to use bluetooth headphones ( no danger of walking off and having your device crash to the floor, or accidentally yanking the headphone wire)Even though this review appears to be negative I'd have to say that for the price of the actual device it's better than just ok, if you're on a tight budget I'd recommend waiting for the special deals when the price drops.I have purchased all 3 of these tablets, 7,8 & 10 inch, and also have the HDX7 and is how I made my assessment .",3.0,Jeanette Nicholson,5 June 2019
"Utter rubbish.  But something, anything, else....","I previously owned a kindle fire 7.  This was small but worked very well, being compact, fast and adaptable.  Really a rather fabulous piece of kit.  The disappointment that is my kindle fire 8HD makes me wonder what happened.  Half the apps are either it allowed (Ebay) or not supported (Firefox).  It's slow.  Really slow...my three year old phone is quicker.  The device is slow at almost eevrything.The screen is poor too.  Somehow the resolution just doesn't seem right.You have to pay to get the Amzon adverts removed - yes... They install them and then you pay to get them removed.  Jesus Geoff...don't you have enough fingers in my digital life.....?I don't understand what went wromg, as the kindle 7 was fantastic.Either way it's pants and mines going back.",1.0,randombob,5 August 2019
Good budget buy,"Given the cost with the current £20 discount (£89 without special offers 32GB)  this is a great budget tablet buy.Now it could be a little faster, have less bloat ware and not be Amazon's tailored android operating system - all slight drawback - but the speed is not a big issue, the bloat ware still leaves loads of space and it can be easily modified to link to Googles 'apps' such as drive, photos, store etc.So really then best of both worlds with Kindle functionality built in too.I previously had a HUDL2 and I would rate them similarly.Biggest downside is that GPS is not implemented so location services/ mapping directions etc. could be a lot better when out and about.I would buy again unless my budget was twice what it was!",4.0,Digger,8 December 2018
Fire HD8 using it more and more!,"I finally accepted that a Kindle Fire could be a good thing.  I intended to use it as a very cheap tablet pairing it with a Bluetooth adapter to connect to my old stereo Arcam amp so I could listen to internet radio and the free Spotify app.  This works brilliantly and I am very pleased with that alone, however I have now been drawn into the world of books on Amazon and have enjoyed downloading and reading new reading experiences.  The HD8 it self is very easy to set up and the screen is first class for reading and I have even watched TV on it with no problems. The ability to highlight a word and be prompted to use either a dictionary or Wikipedia is a great addition.  The ""With special offers"" prompt made me think of paying the extra tenner to not have the ads, but I am glad I didn't as the ads are only a screen saver when the Fire is first woken up displaying ads for books or apps which disappear when swiped up, so don't waste money to get rid of it, or if it becomes a problem for you, it's possible to remove it after you have purchased it for the same amount.If you are thinking of trying a Kindle I would say do it! I am sure like me you will get a lot of pleasure from it.  My only slight moan would be that it's a little bit heavy but is still comfortable to read as any paperback or hard cover book is.At the current price it very hard to find anything that that compares with the Fire HD8.",5.0,Malcolm,5 March 2020
Get a different reader,"Disappointing had the previous kindle fire for 5 years. Seems that in that time all amazons efforts in development of the kindle have been aimed at locking the device even more tightly to the Amazon store so you can only purchase from there, and in providing a marketing tool to bombard customers with junk. The only aspect of the original kindle firebHD interface which was genuinely novel and attractive, i.e the seamless scroll wheel through all apps and books has inexplicable been removed . I can only assume to ensure improved marketing opportunities offered by hard wiring  other apps to the home page. I think this device is designed with Amazon in mind and not its customers!The support is confused and unabe to deliver solutions to basic probkems. The spell checker has to be disabled unless you want to spend your time correct the start of every email from ""Fear"" to ""Dear"". the Longstanding issues navigating the device and locating files remain unaddressedBasically rubbish.",1.0,David Snead,1 June 2019
You get what you pay for ...,"OK. So context wise, I've been an iOS user for a fair while and have an iPad. I bought this Fire Tablet as a 2nd Screen so that the kids didn't argue over sharing the 1 iPad when we went on Holiday and needed something to entertain them for the 7 hour drive to Cornwall, thinking it'd keep life peaceful.The hardware itself seems fine - build quality is alright, battery OK etc - but in practice, I personally find the software terrible. Having setup a couple of Kids profiles, they seem almost impossible to use because they're so restrictive; all my child wanted was the YouTube app installed and a couple of games to play. I ended up just letting him use the adult profile instead, as it felt more familiar to the iOS experience and I could just install games from the app store. That said, there's adverts everywhere you look (such as when you're logging in) which I HATE and it just feels cumbersome overall.In the setup process, they make it very easy to accidentally sign up for the Kids services that cost you £2.50 a month by offering a ""Free 30 days"" that has a massive button to press, where the ""No thanks"" option is a tiny little bit of sub-text you have to really look for.I'm glad I bought this on the Prime-Day sale for £29.99 - because it's cheap enough to now just stuff in a drawer and either forget about, or figure out if I can hack it to be something useful like an input device to my Home Automation setup.In hindsight - I should've stumped up for an iPad, (2nd hand or otherwise).",1.0,Mr W.,25 July 2019
No web browser available on a kids profile kids unlimited overcharging,"Update: I have also just found out that it is not possible to have 2 individual kids unlimited subscriptions on one amazon account. To get this I need a family subscription at £4.99. An individual subscription is £1.99 a month. I have had to source a 2nd device for the youngest (3) to avoid armageddon, so they have profiles on each device. I have found issues at every stage with these devices and really wish I'd never bought them.Tried setting this up for my Daugther (8 years) and surprised to find she is unable to browse the internet with it. I had assumed there would be restricted web access, but there is not even a web browser available on her profile. I have tried enabling the browser in settings (which I assume means that somehow web browsing is possible) but after 3 hours of trying I can't locate it.  Many others on the forum have reported this issues and none of teh suggestions provided work. and Amazon customer service have not responded to help requestd, my own and others by the look of it.  I appreciate the need for safe-guarding, but no web access makes the device redundant.With regard to screen quality, I have alos marked this down as it seemed to fade in and out as I was setting it up. Not sure if this is a real issue yet, but I may never find out if I have to return it due to no web browsing ability.",1.0,Steven John Banner,24 December 2019
great tablet and a low price,"The fire tablet for the money is excellent at £45 on sale.Screen- The screen is pretty good for the size. it fits perfectly for use to watch films whilst remaining portable. The resolution is relatively decent, it is not as high as a flagship premium tablet however the colours and viewing angles are great and make up for the lower resolution.Performance- performance is okay, it will load amazon apps pretty quickly and will be more than useable for internet browsing. I found that it can slow down due when switching between apps quickly but nothing too noticeable.Price- the price is excellent compared to other devices especially when on sale.Apps- apps is the main downside to these tablets. With no access to the google play store i found that it was not useful for my needs and needed to return the device. However if you are invested in the amazon ecosystem  of apps or only need very limited apps it is excellent. My main dislike for the device is the amount of useless apps pre installed on the device that waste valuable space and performance. if the play store was added and the amount of amazon apps reduced or allowed to be removed by the user , this would be the best tablet on the market at the price.Features- it has an acceptable camera for a tablet, an 8 inch screen as well as a good battery life that allowed for long video watching sessions and web browsing. there are very few extra features due to the price point however most of these would never be used by most people so they are not missed.Overall- excellent device and a brilliant price. Its only let down is the restricted amazon app ecosystem and lack of the google play store.",4.0,Elliott,24 November 2019
"Not really put it to the sword yet, but....","I've had a Gen4 Fire-7 for 3 years and was more than happy with it, until it started creaking, so thought as it was a big birthday I'd go for the upgraded size/memory etc.I have only done the basics with it so far, but am more than happy with the speed, clarity, ease of use and continuity of operating so all good so far.The talky/handsfree Alexa seems to be fun, but as an old git it's something I need to get into...or ignore when the novelty wears off.Connecting to my wireless headphones was a trial, but I persevered and all is crystal perfection now.Only complaint, if I had one, is the lack of crossover Apps to FireOS, but I knew that when I decided to stay with Amazon Fire rather than an Android tool, so I can't mark it down for my choice to stay.",5.0,Simon P,13 November 2018
Don’t buy when on sale! Device arrives broke!,"Well this is my second Amazon device and frankly I’m very disappointed. This device out of the box was faulty! Firstly it wouldn’t power on, so I plugged it into the charger with the provided (very short) usb cable and it came on showing 0% battery, while it charged up I activated it and then waited for it to fully charge which was surprisingly fast. However as soon as I disconnected the charger the device switched off and would not power on. So in plugged it in again and again battery showed 0% charge, waited again for it to recharge, and again disconnected it from the charger, guess what, it switches off again and won’t turn on. Repeated the process for a third time, same result.So I go to my Amazon app and request a replacement, told I’d get a email reply in 12 hours. The email then asked me to go live chat and after instructions where I try to turn it on which it wouldn’t they started the process of sending me a replacement. This is when they say it will take 3 days to send it even though I’m a prime user and my area has Amazon Now.  Then they say they can’t authorize a replacement because there’s an error with my card details, and ask for another card which I don’t have since I have no need for any more since my visa debit card is all that I’ve ever needed. I go to check my account that’s fine, I then go and order another Fire HD 8 no issues and then cancelled it. I go back to the chat and I’ve been disconnected!So now I’m calling there customer service line, the agent was very nice, but same issue with my card again. 30 mins on the phone with only maybe 5 minutes of actual talk time, they say still having problems and will call me back later.So not a happy camper now!I would return it and just order a new one but I bought it on the last day of the summer 2019 sale at 25% off. So stuck with no idea what’s going on. It would just be so simple to send a Amazon Now Delivery guy with a replacement but I suppose that’s just to practical.",1.0,James W.,1 September 2019
Disappointing,"Purchased this tablet as an alternative option to laptop for my grandmother.Unfortunately it was difficult to set up, everything was linked to amazon adverts and the number of apps available is very limited.Most of options cannot be switched off which was distressing for my Nan as adverts kept popping up all the time.Could be a good alternative as child’s first tablet, which children protection settings, unfortunately we did not find it user friendly.You also can only set up with with amazon account and not email.Ours was return as we were dissatisfied and it did not meet our need as all we wanted was something to read news, browse google and play games like candy crush.The only positive thing about this tablet was a nice red colour.If you want to purchase it, I’d suggest that you visit shops which sell them to have a look at to before buying it.",1.0,Mal,4 February 2020
Mainly silly kid's games apps,"I bought this tablet to replace my old Hudl 2 which had given up the ghost.Although good value at under £60, I have found it to be very slow and spend a lot of time staring at a blank screen waiting for something to happen.The selection of apps are very limited: most of them being silly games meant for kids.The useful 'tool' apps normally available on Android tablets are mostly not compatible with this device.I do believe it's possible to download Google Play store to obtain more useful apps, but the process seems very complicated unless you are a computer buff a nd understand the abbreviations you need to imput.So it looks like I will need to purchase another Android tablet to enjoy the applications I'm used to.Another thing is that the camera leaves a lot to be desired.",3.0,Spadger,30 November 2018
"Gawd, this thing is slooooooow","If you like screaming in fury at a blank screen as it resolutely ignores you, only for it to spasm into life ten seconds later, by which time the string of expletives have polluted the childrens' ears, scared the cat and confused this lump of inert glass almost completely. It then asks you to enter your passcode, by which time you will probably have hurled the thing out of the window. What is the point of voice control, when it then asks you to put in a passcode every time you want to use it?It gets two stars, because as a cheap 'traditional' tablet it is fine. In show mode , whilst on its stand it is no better than one of those digital photo frames popular ten years ago - but even then, it dims the photos (not configurable) so it can present some inane headlines about who has been kicked out of the jungle/won a dance on Strictly.Great idea, but-  in practice -  a pain in the posterior.",2.0,S.

Kids tablet only,"I'll give you my backgroundI'm 30 years oldI have a 2.5 year boyA 2015 iPad MiniA 2012 iPad 3A 2019 iPadA Huawei Mate 20 proI love my tech and I do not have time for cheap tacky products that freezeGoing into buying this, my sole purpose was for a CCTV screen.

It's basic quality.For my son its fine but for say a 5 year old they would get frustrated at the input lag and lack of ram.This tablet is perfect for 3 consumers1. Elderly person who doesnt have a clue what good tech is and just wants to have it for say video calling or Netflix2. A child under 53.

"Cheap, but fiddly/frustrating to use, a cluttered, uncontrollable mess. Buy something better.","Reviewing this from the point of view of a parent of Y2 children. Yes, it's cheap. But, it's frustrating to use. Slick it is not. It is the entry level tablet for entry level tablets. You can't get more basic than this. But it has good parental controls and supports multiple profiles. And it was only about £60.Likes:Multiple profilesParental controls and setting time limitsAdding customisable list of websites (for young children)Age-related contentCheap as chips (although the quality reflects this)Dislikes:Fiddly settingsIncredibly messy home screens set by Amazon that can't be changedAdverts when switching between profiles meaning entering your PIN twiceTwo icons for web browsers: one called 'internet' another called 'Silk' but both appear to be the same (why??)Despite enabling web browser for children's profile a web browser doesn't appear - meaning that the websites you added for your children's profiles cannot be accessedDespite promises of 'thousands of age-related websites' there are only a few (are the rest in the missing browser? Who knows...Amazon adding Kids Unlimited probably because I clicked on something (Amazon has a history of adding stuff without you realising - see Amazon Prime). This may be from the initial purchase - SO BE WARNED AFTER A YEAR TO KEEP AN EYE OUT ON YOUR CARD FOR AMAZON SUBSCRIPTIONS.Screen quality - it is NOT HD. Like the Ring app (that Amazon own and promote as 'HD') Amazon's version of HD doesn't seem to be everyone else's.Poor photo quality - you don't want this to take memorable family snapsImpossible to speak to anyone at Amazon to provide feedback toI also have an iPad Air which cost 10x this. Like comparing a BMW 5 series and a Dacia Sandero, you cannot compare the two. But you may want to pay more if it was just slightly slicker to use and had better features. If the stuff above doesn't bother you and you have incredibly low expectations of quality then this is the perfect 5-star tablet for you. But that low price comes at a cost: hours of frustration. I don't have time for that, personally.",2.0,tastyfish,7 September 2020
It's a good reliable Tabley.,I brought my red tablet so I can watch and download netflix programmes/films. I download things sp my kids can watch things in the car too. Unfortunately you cannot use the tablet unless there is WiFi otherwise. I sometimes download things to watch from Iplayer to when I'm put and about too. It's a good reasonable tablet. I brought my son the kids edition before this and I also brought a blue tablet too (unfortunately I broke the screen) and they do last for a very long time. Make sure you buy a screen protector and a cover so your tablet is more protected.  Unfortunately of yiu break the screen you may as well just buy a new tablet because getting it fixed cost the similar about of what the tablet costs.

"Good Value - at least, it was.","I bought this on special offer for £44.99 when my Tesco Hudl died.  As supplied, it is full of ad crap and bloat, but it can be de-amazonized quite easily using the instructions and toolbox from liliputing.  Then, any app can be installed, including those on the Google app store.I have to admit, I’m not a great tablet user but I find it useful as a controller for my focusing rail and as a screen for viewing remote cameras.  It seems to have all the functionality that the Hudl had, although the internal camera is not as good.  This doesn’t bother me as I don’t use it for taking photos. For the money, I don’t think you could beat it, although I see that the price has now jumped up to £79.99…hmm, not so good!",5.0,Dave,23 February 2020
Great tablet,"I bought this to replace my ancient iPad. Although I can't get all the apps that I could from Apple, I just save the web pages on my browser. Internet is fast, the fire uses Silk . Camera is not the best but I didn't buy it to take photos. Battery life is very good, lasting 2 days with normal use. The home page is nice and easy to navigate books and magazines.  I don't use Alexa so I can't comment on that, but for the price it is well worth considering.",4.0,L. D'Costa,11 March 2020
Terrible,"The hardware its self is not the problem its amazons limited OS.Cant install apps from google play store, doesnt even have google play store, you have to mess about altering the whole. once u install an APK there is no way to install it to the kid account,Infuriating to use. probably the worst tablet ive ever usedThere is no file browser...Just everything you want to do there is some block or issue or simply wont allow it to be done.I can NOT reccomend it, it is simply infuriatng and frustrating to try to do anything on other than what amazon wants you to go on (eg only amazon things!).100% terrible product!",1.0,Mark T.,28 May 2020
Excellent compliment for other Amazon devices & apps,"I bought this tablet whilst on offer so it was excellent value (half price). It works well and the screen quality is excellent.I got it primarily for books and audible purchases but have used it for internet searches and watching video's and it works really well, the sound quality is good too.Please do your research before buying, this device does not work with many android and google apps so don't expect chrome, docs, ebay etc, but Amazon's internet browser, Silk is perfectly adequate once you've gotten use to it. Don't buy it thinking its a cheap android tablet, it's not.I would recommend getting this tablet to complement your other Amazon products and apps (Prime video, Kindle, Audible etc) as they all work in sync.",5.0,Mrs R,19 April 2020
Amazing tablet but not sure about the subscriptions.,"I’ve been using this tablet for 3 weeks now, and I am overall happy with this tablet. To be honest this tablet is very good quality and the price is very reasonable. The problems are, you have to pay for your subscriptions, and it’s not very clear how does the subscription work like you have to pay for each app ie Amazon Music, Amazon Video or Amazon Kindle etc. It’s not really user friendly and it’s cost quite a lot of money. And I only just able to finished one movie since I tried on the Amazon Prime 2 weeks ago. And the movie choices are really limited unless you are willing to pay extra for more choices. So I don’t think I will continue my subscription since I don’t think it’s necessary.",3.0,Vinson C,30 December 2019
Delighted with my purchase,"I bought the Kindle Fire 8 to read eBooks - being able to check my emails and social media is a bonus. I had intended to buy the smaller and cheaper Fire 7 but when I saw them in the flesh I much preferred reading on the larger version. To begin with, the reflective screen meant I couldn't read outside on the balcony, but the easily applied Tech Armor Anti-glare screen dealt with that. I considered saving £10 by not having the Special Offers appear every time I opened the Fire, but I quite like them, even the silly ones,  and when they are for eBooks, they are useful. It's biggest advantage for me is that it weighs about half of my full size iPad and fits easily into my handbag. I haven't really explored all the Apps available but was delighted to find that, unlike with my Kindle Oasis, I could download the Cloud Library app and borrow eBooks from my local library. And it's so much cheaper than its competitor, the mini iPad!",5.0,JH,29 August 2019
Quality and very well equipped,"Primarily to assist my reading.

Fantastic - but will they last?,"I have purchased several of the Fire 8 tablets for myself and my husband.  Two of them failed completely after about 18 months of use.  I absolutely love the features and ease of use, but I had so much loaded onto the tablets when they failed and am therefore deeply disappointed.  Amazon help-desk really tried to assist me to get them working again, and when they could not offered me a discount on a replacement, as on both occasions they were out of guarantee.  I have much older Kindle Fire models which are still going strong, so wonder if I got faulty models or if this is a design flaw.  I will not be buying another - going to try the 7 instead.",3.0,Extra Mum,23 January 2020
Great tablet for the price!,"I bought a refreshed Fire 8HD Tablet from Amazon Marketplace. It was marketed as minor cosmetic damage but no damage was visible and it arrived in almost perfect condition.The tablet works great and will suit it purpose of being a 8"" Alexa Show mode device / small tablet.All in all a great purchase.About the tablet itself...It's no iPad, Its' not as easy to use or as robust, which you would expect.the screen looks sharp and colour is good. movies are smooth and look pretty good although HDR is not supported.Cosmetically the device looks a little cheap, again as you would expect, but is perfectly usable. Its made of plastic and is thus quite flexible.Sound quality is as expected in that it isn't fantastic but works well.This is the second Fire 8 in the household having purchased one for a family member earlier in the year. That tablet works well for my 6 year old hence buying a second.I would recommend this tablet, for the price its a good buy!",4.0,Darren,27 December 2019
Simply unusable,"I purchased this device fully aware it was not going to be a cheap ipad or Samsung rival but the reviews made me think it would be suitable as a very basic device. Unfortunately the device operation is clunky and frequently freezes, refusing to respond to most inputs. Notifications (despite being turned off) pop up constantly, seemingly causing the freezing issue. Battery life is very poor compared to previous Samsung/Apple products. The lack of Google apps is the final nail in the coffin. Although not caring if I use Google as a search engine or not, both Google maps and YouTube are a must on a device like this as Amazon's own versions are incredibly poor.Having now experienced a Fire tablet, next time I will happily pay the extra to get a 'proper' tablet that actually works.",1.0,Eddy B,27 April 2019
Wonderful invention.,"I have been using an early model kindle for about eight years with Amazon Prime, and enjoyed every page. However at night, always had to read with the bedlight on. I decided to give the Fire HD 8 a try as it is about the same size as the kindle. I purchased it mainly for reading, (I'm retired) and  I cannot believe just how versatile this technology is. I have just been overseas and was so pleased to be able to keep up to date with emails. What a bonus that is. So much more to discover. Reading at night with the auto blue light cancelling, linked to sunset and sun rise, automatically. Just WOW!!!!!  This is such a wonderful invention, and just the right size for me. Battery life is amazing. I Love this Fire HD 8",5.0,Baustin,11 June 2019
"Great Value, but Amazon could have made it better!","I got this, because Amazon offered a fantastic deal on this! They brought the price down from 90 to 60£, for that price range it is a bargain, so for me it was an impulse purchase.The Pros, excellent value for moneyU can use it as a Kindle, and use it for netflix, prime video, browsing etcHD screenSupports SD card, just keep all ur photos and videos on that card and unburden other devicesConsWhile the screen is HD, it is not as good a quality screen as i was hoping, my old Nexus 7 2012 has a better screenBut the biggest con is battery life is very mediocre and no support for fast chargeHere is hoping Amazon makes a better model for this in the yrs to come",3.0,Deen Sheikh,25 January 2020
Superb value for money,"I wasnt expecting much for the price. I'm glad to say this tablet (Fire HD 8 16gb) surprised me.Purchased for my daughter 8yo as her ageing ipod microphone had packed in so she couldn't video call her friends.In the past she has used an iPad mini and an iPad 2nd gen. This doesn't have the same power but for what shes using it for it doesn't matter. Shes very happy with it.The screen is fine. The bezel size is fine. Sound is a little flaky but that's common in most tablets. It's not the smoothest switching between apps but it's not been an issue. I haven't looked into battery life as shes obsessed with having it on charge. I'm not a fan of the Amazon launcher, I can change it if needed but shes not really bothered so I'll most likely leave it. Oh and it has a microsd slot if she ever needs more storage.In short, value for money wise its excellent.I got the special offers version and tbh I haven't noticed them once.If they were in stock at the min for the same price I'd probably get another one.",5.0,R Williams,5 May 2020
"Pay £80 for adverts, adverts and more adverts.","The adverts are infuriating. I can't think of any other physical product where you spend all that money just to be bombarded with adverts. Adverts when you log on. Adverts every time you wake it up. It's just make the whole tablet annoying to use. As a result, I very rarely do use it.The tablet itself is ok and would be a 4 star product considering the price. It's certainly no ipad. The layout of the icons isn't as intuitive. The buttons are quite cumbersome and have to be pressed quite hard to work. But given the price it's ok.But he most annoying thing, and I'm not sure I've mentioned this, is the adverts.

So I paid £10 to get rid of them, only to find out that all the apps autimatically update and again more data that goes when you do not want to. So then again I spend time to figure out how to turn off all these automatic updates (not very simple)... and then I found out that the device automatically updates itself without asking for your permission. So I am out of data again for the 3rd time this month, while before I would not use it all up. I asked if it is possible to turn off Automatic System updated and umbelievably so - it is not possible!

Reliability not so good,"Easy to set up and get access to all my content from previous kindles. This is my 5th kindle and 2nd Fire, so you could say I’m pretty much an expert with the brand. I mainly use it as a reader and an easy access to my music in conjunction with Alexa.Now the downside:After about six months it starts to get glitchy accessing the bookstore and navigating the menu, often jumping from one menu to another without warning. Then it gets stroppy regarding the memory card I’ve installed often complaining about incorrect formatting. Finally, the screen cracks of its own accord despite the screen protector and protective case. Not the first time this has happened I might add!! Of course, this happens 4 weeks outside the warranty. Amazon no longer repair kindles and all they were able to offer was a 15% discount on a new one.Impression of Amazon takes a nose dive, frustration increases proportionally.",2.0,Boz,26 February 2020

Brilliant quality tablet - but has problems,"I have no problem recommending this fire tablet. For the price, the quality is outstanding. Yes, it's tied to Amazon, but I have no problem with that as there are ways of getting around loading Google Playstore, so you can have a brilliant Android tablet at a stupid price.  Buy it, you won't regret it!Update at 15 months after purchase: Wifi connection keeps dropping out, even though we have a solid BT router that still connects with all our other devices. I have to keep turning off wifi on the tablet and turning it back on again to get it to re-connect.

Could be better.,"The hardware and durability are of a very good quality just like previous amazon tablets we have owned. Like those, this one has good potential as a comfortable everyday device. However, in stock form, for those that like to customize their devices, this firmware is a nightmare!The lock screen ads are to be fair, normal for amazon and can be unlocked for a small fee. The real issues are a launcher that you can't change, updates that go ahead despite being set to not auto update followed by a complete disregard for previous user settings and constant nags to register...We buy many thousands of pounds worth of goods from Amazon each year and are generally very pleased with the service received.

"Quite decent for the price, but poor battery life after a very short while.","A decent tablet for its price range. Quite slow in doing what a tablet should do, but again, price appropriate.Sadly the battery life is a big let down.

Reasonable tablet for the price,"If your going to pay 80 quid for a tablet then you cant expect alot.However for browsing the internet and a bit of amazon prime video / netflix you cant complain.What lets it down for me is the basic amazon app store which doesnt have access to any banking apps and the fact that it isnt true android software, compared to how clean your phone homescreen is this is just a mass of amazon advertising loaded with loads of amazon apps that you cant remove from the homescreen, let aloan delete.I ended up downloading the apk for the proper Google play store which surprisingly the aps seem to work ok and bundling all the apps into folders to try and tidy thescreen a little.If u want to shop amazon, watch amazon and do a bit of browsing its ok but hard to recommend.Dissappointed really as if you buy online it doesn't really come across as an amazon loss leader to push its prime services but basically thats what it is.

Small reduction in Android functionality means big reduction in utility,"If you want decent tablet functionality, do not buy this item. This item was a present from my wife to replace my existing Android tablet which had ceased to work properly. The Fire HD has a cut-down Android operating system. Unfortunately that makes it incompatible with my already-paid for Android Apps previously sourced from Google Play - it would be bad enough having to pay for them again but not being able to access them at all is pants. Not only that, but for some of the Apps I use most, Amazon Apps Store does not have an equivalent I could buy instead, except at a much inflated price. Out of curiosity,  is the inability of the Fire to interact with the Google Play Store a consequence of reduced functionality, or has Amazon deliberately ""locked out"" Google Play Store?  A second and worse issue is that when trying to access Amazon my previously registered e-mail address was not even recognised - the system then set up an unusable e-mail address for me and apparently the only way I can remove it is by de-registering the device or doing a factory reset; who is supposed to be in charge here, the customer or the provider? I now no longer know for certain what state my Amazon account settings are in - e-bay is starting to look inviting. No doubt the Fire is useful for playing mickey mouse games, listening to pop or watching vacuous Youtube and Netflix casts, but as a proper tablet it leaves an awful lot to be desired - so much so that I have repaired my old tablet and now use that again; when it finally packs up I shall get a proper Android tablet. As this item was a present, I cannot even take it back and get a decent machine, so it will spend the rest of its days in a drawer.",1.0,J Dogg,26 January 2019

Excellent budget tablet let down by forced adverts,"Bought this tablet for our daughter for Christmas as it was relatively cheap and would allow her to play simple games, watch netflix, prime and iPlayer.My only gripe with it is that I bought the one with 'Special Offers' which is effectively Amazon's way of trying to get more revenue by advertisements on your tablet as soon as you turn it on. They simply aren't special offers, they are adverts and this is what I have the issue with. I resent this and I resent having to pay £10 to have the adverts removed. I think this is pure greed and when I've tried to get them to remove it for free, they won't.So although this is a lovely quality tablet for the price and has relatively good levels of spec for a budget tablet, I think I should be able to decide whether I want adverts or not, not Amazon. I've bought the tablet and therefore own it, must I now be forced to view the adverts that they deem appropriate, or should I pay £10 to have them removed. Clearly they acknowledge that it is an annoyance simply by offering their removal for £10.Pretty disgusting if you ask me.",3.0,N Sturman,30 December 2018
Fine as an e-reader. Useless as a tablet.,"I bought this because it was well-reviewed and cost less than it would’ve done to get my iPad mini repaired or replaced.I’ve used this for a few months now and found it maddeningly awful.The screen isn’t responsive enough: what should be one single tap is often a tap, then a harder tap, then an angrier swearier tap-tap-tap-TAP. It’s also less responsive to a finger-touch than a stylus, which is (a) inconvenient, having to make sure you’ve got a stylus handy, and (b) old-fashioned, having to use a separate tool to have any kind of success.The processor has a tendency to be really sluggish: it’s like being back on dialup waiting for it to do things sometimes.Similarly the speed it takes to realise the direction you’re holding your tablet and correct the screen display isn’t great, maybe 1-2 seconds, which might not sound much but it’s far from the immediate response you should expect.Also, several times I’ve had an error message that some of the Amazon Prime Video content isn’t available. It’s bizarre to have problems accessing Amazon’s video content on Amazon’s video app on Amazon’s tablet, when I’ve never had this issue on a non-Amazon device.This is absolutely fine as an e-reader or if you’ve never used a tablet before, so if you’re just looking for a Kindle that does a little bit more, or if you’re completely new to tablets, then this will be fine for you. Personally, I regret wasting money on this when it could’ve gone towards a far superior device.",1.0,Ms C.,16 May 2019

Easy to set up and use.,I bought this as a replacement for my fire tablet that just packed up working.

I was up and running straight away!,5.0,mrs c a green,8 February 2021
Just don't do it.,I knew I was selling my soul to amazon but wow. £10 so my screen saver isn't adverts!The app store is limited and you have to use an external download site if you want anything decent.Does work well though I'll give it that.

Good Replacement for Fire 7,"Bought this as a replacement for my son's Fire 7 which he had used to death!

Poor in several ways,"Surprisingly heavy, and really slow to load. Very locked down, so hard to get the apps you really want (instead of the proxies Amazon tries to foist on you).

Does what I want.,"I bought this to upgrade from my hdx7 which I dropped and broke the screen.

Disappointed,"I was looking forward to getting my Fire HD 8 during Prime Week as i can never get a hold of the other tablets in the household but this was going to be mine. I have to say that overall i am disappointed. Its mainly a few small things which have led to an overall poor experience. First thing is it is a bit slow, have been used to an ipad mini which despite its age is much faster than the Fire HD. I cant install Google Chrome as the web browser and you cannot even import the bookmarks. And i didn't realise at the time but i bought the tablet with special offers. Sounds good? No it means you get adverts on the lock screen and  have to pay £10 to get rid of them. I am probably being a bit harsh giving the tablet 2 stars but just wanted Amazon to register how i feel.",2.0,Fraser,9 August 2019

It doesn’t feel cheap in the slightest and I’m really glad I went for one of these over an iPad. Only minor complaint is the apps - whilst there are the majority of best known apps available, there’s two or three google ones that I wish I had on here (official google drive app, google earth, OS Maps) as I wanted to use the tablet predominantly for route planning. There are unofficial work arounds though and some unofficial versions of the apps that work fine. Other than that, can’t rate it highly enough.",5.0,Andy B,30 June 2019

Sure, more powerful and sleek tablets are available, but for MUCH higher prices.In terms of delivering good speed, picture, sound, and features, this pretty much covers every aspect you need a tablet to, and all for £60.Within 10 minutes of turning it on for the first time I had the google play store installed using easy instructions found online, instantly removing most of the limitations of the device (out of the packet it can only access amazon's app store).An iPad may be more desirable, more powerful, but for the difference in price this is a huge win for Amazon.",5.0,The Mancalorian,15 February 2019
